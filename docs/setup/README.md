# Setup

This folder contains concise setup instructions to get a developer up and running quickly.

See:

- `01-quick-start.md` — minimal quick start to run the stack
- `02-local-development.md` — developing and iterating on the backend
- `03-accessing-services.md` — practical commands to access services (psql, redis, HTTP)

Use these pages for day-0 onboarding. If you need more depth, the full docs live under `docs/book/`.
